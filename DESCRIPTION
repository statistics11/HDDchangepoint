Description: This package implements our algorithms for detecting single and multiple high dimensional change points
             using new dissimilarity measure and distance matrices. The main functions are called "multiple_changepoint_detection" and 
             "multiple_changepoint_detection_wbs" which, respectively, run our algorithms for multiple change point detection using recursive binary segmentation and wild binary segmentation. 
             There are some other functions which can be used to calculate: "the new dissimilarity distance", "the proposed test statistic" and "single change point detection" 
             Also, a test data set is included together with the real data set analysed in the paper
